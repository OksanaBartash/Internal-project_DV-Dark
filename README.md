#2 Internal-project Dobrogo-vechora-Dark

This is the site of Vinitsa's IT-Academy "INTITA", designed for students to enhance their skills. 
It was one of the first projects in my life, where I collaborated with fellow students, working seamlessly and always ready to assist each other.

My contributions to this site include:

    * Loader - visible during the site's loading process;
    * Block "You have suffered from the consequences of war (Sign up)...";
    * Block "Specializations";
    * Footer with the "Up" button;
    * Page "Developers";
    * English version page the site.

During my work on this project, I utilized HTML, CSS for typesetting, (extensively employing flex) and JavaScript. 
I used Bootstrap library, convert and compress images, and work with Figma, Trello.
The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets with adaptive adjustments for both images and text.
I connected buttons to links for social networking and sharing links, making them responsive to user actions by adding active and hover states. 
I also implemented transitions between site pages and used links to connect various blocks for seamless navigation. 
With the help of JavaScript code, the "Up" button assists users in returning to the header from any block on the site.
